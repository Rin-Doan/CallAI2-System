A,Problem Investigation,Positive,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed. 
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,As I have checked you were charged some fees because you were not able to pay on time so that means we really cannot do anything about it anymore.
A,Problem Resolution,Negative,"No, no sir. "

A,Greetings,Positive,How can I make you smile today?
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh. I understand that fees are really costly.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"As I have checked, the account was charged some fees because there was no payment made before the cut off time of 4 p.m."
A,Engagement,Positive,I truly understand what you're going through Mr. Breed.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"However, the fees charged were valid and therefore, the fees can no longer be refunded or removed."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"I understand your concern sir and as much as I want to remove the fees, they really can no longer be removed."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"However, since you requested, okay, I will send a request to the management and it's up to them to decide whatever course of action they will do after reviewing your account but this doesn't guarantee that the fees will be refunded."

A,Greetings,Positive,Thank you for calling Shapes Reward.
A,Greetings,Positive,My name is Mathilda.
A,Greetings,Positive,Can I have your name please?
A,Greetings,Positive,Hi Miss Collins.
A,Greetings,Positive,How can I be of service?
A,Engagement,Positive,Oh I'm so sorry for the inconvenience for the website.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know what error message you got?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,You mentioned you were trying to log in.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"When you logged into shapes rewards website, can you please tell me what happened after?"
A,Engagement,Positive,I understand Miss Collins.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Alright this what actually happened.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,When you clicked log in and the screen or the page goes back to the exact same page after loading that means that the page is looping.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"However, your browser has an issue."
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Looping is when the browser page goes back to the same page again and again even though you've already taken action.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Just like in your case, you've clicked log in but it doesn't go to your profile on Shapes Rewards, right?"
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,It just keeps going back to the login page but don't worry you've got the right person on the line to help you.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,We just need to do quick troubleshooting on your browser.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Are you using Mac or PC?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know what browser you're using?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,Is it Google Chrome or Firefox?
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,May I know the chrome version?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I'll just give you instructions and we'll get through this.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes, can you please close the Chrome browser and open it again after?"
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Now that you have the browser open, do you see 3 dots that are aligned vertically on the upper right part of your screen?"
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Please click that and you will see a drop-down box.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then look for the word help or about Google Chrome.
A,Engagement,Positive,Wow thank you.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Looks like you have the most updated browser versions so far.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, the next thing, we will do is clear cache from your browser."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,This will not affect your stored files or anything on your computer.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It's just that most of the time the information that you click out to the Internet gets saved in a cache memory or storage in your browser and this eventually results to latency or what you just experienced.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,So just click those three dots that you clicked earlier and look for more tools.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Did you see it?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then you will see clear browsing data.
A,Engagement,Positive,"Alright, we are on the right track."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,We can just go to the basic part and make sure you check all the checkboxes for the browsing history cookies and cached images.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Then, if you see the time range you can choose all time. "
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Then just click clear data.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So once it's done loading, you will be on the same page."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, just press f5 on your keyboard to let it refresh and then you can start logging in again."
A,Closure,Positive,I am so happy for you too Miss Collins and it has been my pleasure to assist you.
A,Closure,Positive,Did I address all your concerns today?

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So if we send it to you today, you should receive the oven before your son's birthday on Thursday."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,All I need from you to make that happen is the photo of the wrong item you received along with a photo of the barcode.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Is it possible that you could send to me while we're on the line so I could already process the reshipment for you?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Good point Amber and I understand your doubt.

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,No chance for a second mistake happening.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, that is why aside from the 24 hour shipping, we will also do a thorough recheck of the reshipment."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"So, I can definitely assure you that it's going to be the correct item this time."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Um, by the way Amber, do you also have the photo of the barcode of the cutting board?"
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes Amber, I would need it to have your reshipment approved as soon as possible."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"After that, we will ship the oven to you immediately and you should receive it within 24 hours."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Um so now, I will forward the photos to the reshipment team and you should receive the oven tomorrow."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"About the cutting board you received, you don't have to return it."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Um just feel free to keep it keep it or give it away.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yeah, yes all you have to do now is to wait for the replacement to arrive tomorrow."

A,Account Verification,Positive,It's located in front of your printer at the lower right side.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Thank you and just to clarify when you said that the printer is not working, do you mean it's not turning on or do you see any error message or you can't print from your computer?"
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,"Alright, do you have a windows computer or a mac?"
A,Engagement,Positive,Thank you.
A,Problem Investigation,Positive,It's uh connected wirelessly or usb cable?

A,Problem Investigation,Positive,That means there's no problem on your printer. 
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,We will now proceed in checking your connection.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"First, let's reboot your modem."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It's an upright standing box given by your internet provider.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It has a blinking green light on it.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Yes, please go to your modem and at the back there's a tiny black cable that looks like an old cell phone charger."

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Once you see at least four green lights, please let me know."
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Can you please try printing?
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,Let's check if your printer is connected to the same network as your computer.

A,Problem Resolution,Positive,I see you have to highlight the box where you need to type in the password and press enter.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,It will give you a keyboard and you have to use the arrow buttons to select a letter and press enter to input the selected letter.
A,Problem Resolution,Positive,"Awesome, just remember that it is case sensitive. "
