Problem Investigation,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
Problem Investigation,I'll see what I can do Mr. Breed. 
Problem Investigation,As I have checked you were charged some fees because you were not able to pay on time so that means we really cannot do anything about it anymore.
Problem Investigation,Let me check your account to see what really happened.
Problem Investigation,"As I have checked, the account was charged some fees because there was no payment made before the cut off time of 4 p.m."
Problem Investigation,May I know what error message you got?
Problem Investigation,You mentioned you were trying to log in.
Problem Investigation,"When you logged into shapes rewards website, can you please tell me what happened after?"
Problem Investigation,Alright this what actually happened.
Problem Investigation,When you clicked log in and the screen or the page goes back to the exact same page after loading that means that the page is looping.
Problem Investigation,"However, your browser has an issue."
Problem Investigation,Looping is when the browser page goes back to the same page again and again even though you've already taken action.
Problem Investigation,"Just like in your case, you've clicked log in but it doesn't go to your profile on Shapes Rewards, right?"
Problem Investigation,It just keeps going back to the login page but don't worry you've got the right person on the line to help you.
Problem Investigation,We just need to do quick troubleshooting on your browser.
Problem Investigation,Are you using Mac or PC?
Problem Investigation,May I know what browser you're using?
Problem Investigation,Is it Google Chrome or Firefox?
Problem Investigation,May I know the chrome version?
Problem Investigation,Let me check your transactions for you real quick.
Problem Investigation,"I see that the last transaction made was using your debit card at Target for 179 54, 179 dollars and 54 cents."
Problem Investigation,"Yes, This just posted today."
Problem Investigation,Is this valid?
Problem Investigation,I'll be happy to check that for you.
Problem Investigation,How many of your friends are staying?
Problem Investigation,Do you prefer to stay in one room or separate rooms?
Problem Investigation,"Alright, let me check if you have an available room for what days?"
Problem Investigation,Are you going to reserve today?
Problem Investigation,"Okay, according to our systems data you did pay your last bill last October 20, which was two days ago in one of our affiliated payment centers."
Problem Investigation,"Unfortunately when you pay through that affiliated center, it takes about 2 to 3 business days more to complete the payment processing."
Problem Investigation,So that means that the system considered the payment as still pending and not completed yet.
Problem Investigation,"So the connection has been cut off, but."
Problem Investigation,So we are well aware that you have been a valued customer of deluxe for 8 years now. 
Problem Investigation,"Shows here that you don't have a DSL signal, that's why.you cannot connect"
Problem Investigation,We can actually fix this over the phone and I'd be glad to walk you through.
Problem Investigation,Would that be fine?
Problem Investigation,"Let me ask, can you please check your modem now and tell me which lights are on?"
Problem Investigation,"Alright, clearly, there is something wrong with your signal which is highly likely connected to your cell phone service."
Problem Investigation,"So, may I know what your question is?"
Problem Investigation,"I understand sometimes looking at your bill can be quite confusing. So, let me check your account and let's go through this together ok?"
Problem Investigation,By the way do you have a copy of your bill right now?
Problem Investigation,Let's go over your bill together and see the difference.
Problem Investigation,"Upon checking your account., yes, you're right."
Problem Investigation,The bill last month was $25 however this billing period there is an additional charge of 10 dollars for a data usage that totals to 3 gigs.
Problem Investigation,Can you please tell me more about the mail you received?
Problem Investigation,I will be happy to check your account so that I can help you better.
Problem Investigation,"Let me check your account real quick, ok?"
Problem Investigation,"I've been checking here Peter, it shows that a claim for $1000 was paid last week that was August 12 and that it says that it actually covers your entire bill."
Problem Investigation,"So, just to confirm your order is a bouquet of red and white roses that's going to be $45."
Problem Investigation,"I understand that it is very frustrating and to work out on your problem about the abrupt disconnection, is that right sir?"
Problem Investigation,"Thank you, just a minute sir,  I'll just look at our data."
Problem Investigation,"According to our system's data, that you did pay your last bill, last February 5 which was 2 days ago in one of our affiliated payment centers."
Problem Investigation,"Unfortunately sir, when you pay through that affiliated center, it takes about three to five business days more to complete the payment processing so that means that the system conceded the payment as still pending and not completed yet."
Problem Investigation,"So, the connection has been cut off. But."
Problem Investigation,What product are you interested in purchasing?
Problem Investigation,"A dozen of red roses, do you want long stems?"
Problem Investigation,Thank you Mr. Jeremy and did you want the invoice made out in your name or your company name?
Problem Investigation,"Great, now 217 spotlights are available in 35 watts or 55 watts, which one do you want?"
Problem Investigation,All right and do you know what colour temperature you want for the vaults?
Problem Investigation,"Okay, Thank you, now, for the postage, we have registered post or express post."
Problem Investigation,Which one are you interested in?
Problem Investigation,"It seems that you are referring to Meets Attack 500x5, am i right?"
Problem Investigation,"Cool, based on the information here yeah, it already passed the estimated delivery date."
Problem Investigation,"Max, when you place your first order, Rex Global contacts your issuing bank to confirm the validity of the payment method."
Problem Investigation,It is not an actual charge but a one dollar authorisation hold.
Problem Investigation,"One second, let me check the details for a while."
Problem Investigation,"Based on the information, here it was delivered and received."
Problem Investigation,"Hmm, based on the record here, it seems that the parcel was delivered to the wrong address."
Problem Investigation,Give me one moment please so I can pull up your account.
Problem Investigation,"Okay, I got your order here and it was for a convection oven for 129."
Problem Investigation,Is this correct?
Problem Investigation,I know that our shipping department tries to their best to keep the orders as accurate as possible but on very rare occasions this kind of mistake happens from time to time.
Problem Investigation,"Of course, this is not an excuse and a mistake is a mistake."
Problem Investigation,"It was for the month of July this year, right?"
Problem Investigation,"Okay, I have your account pulled up now and I'm only seeing a 30 charge for the month of July this year."
Problem Investigation,Could you recheck your bill and review the amount?
Problem Investigation,"I also checked your other month's charges this year from January to July 2020 and all of these months, you were only charged 30."
Problem Investigation,Let me just check further though your last year.
Problem Investigation,"Oh, although I am seeing a 33 dollar charge here but this was way back last year on July 2019."
Problem Investigation,Would you mind checking the year of the billing paper you're holding right now?
Problem Investigation,Do you still have the return tracking from the courier company when you returned the item?
Problem Investigation,That's actually the return authorization from Coats and Gowns.
Problem Investigation,"When you returned the item to the courier company for shipping, this should have provided you with the return tracking."
Problem Investigation,Do you still have that?
Problem Investigation,It's actually printed in the upper right part of the receipt.
Problem Investigation,"Anyway, I tried to search for your name and nothing is coming up."
Problem Investigation,Now I just want to make sure that I have the correct details.
Problem Investigation,I will check on the details here on my end.
Problem Investigation,Now I can actually see here that you have called the quality informers that you'd like to return the item on the 15th of November.
Problem Investigation,Is that correct?
Problem Investigation,"Yes, now did you return the item to company in the same day that you called?"
Problem Investigation,"So, you already checked your account and nothing has been credited yet in the card ending in 753."
Problem Investigation,Is that right?
Problem Investigation,"Thanks John, I located your information the newest version we have available for your vehicle is version 7.7 which was released in March of 2012."
Problem Investigation,The price of the new map is $99 plus shipping and taxes.
Problem Investigation,"Uhm, I see you've purchased your phone four days ago without mail delivery insurance."
Problem Investigation,"And, policy states without mail delivery insurance, we can't issue you a replacement."
Problem Investigation,"Well, according to your account, you are not paying for standard premium or ultra premium insurance."
Problem Investigation,"So no, it's policy."
Problem Investigation,Well.
Problem Investigation,Your account requires immediate action.
Problem Investigation,I have an important information about your Grey Home medical account.
Problem Investigation,Our records indicate that your account with greyhound medical is past due with a balance of 69.33.
Problem Investigation,Let me quickly check the status of your order.
Problem Investigation,"As I've checked on the tracking information, the dispatch time is 8.45 am and our driver is just five minutes away from your place."
Problem Investigation,"Again, I apologize for the delay Miss Williams and I would like to thank you for your patience as a valued customer of red plate."
Problem Investigation,"So, let me take your order."
Problem Investigation,What products are you interested in ordering?
Problem Investigation,One dozen of white roses.
Problem Investigation,Do you want long stems?
Problem Investigation,Would you like to add a pack of Fran's chocolates?
Problem Investigation,"Since you mentioned that you're in hospital right now and you need to get in touch with your son immediately, I'll make sure that I won't let you go unless and until all your services is up and running."
Problem Investigation,"And, just in case that we need to do some troubleshooting steps, do you have any alternate number that I can use?"
Problem Investigation,"Alright, so as I looked into your account, I've seen that you're in a forty dollar plan that gives you four gigs of data with unlimited calls and text."
Problem Investigation,And your plan will not expire until the 14th of October.
Problem Investigation,You've mentioned earlier that you don't have a service right.
Problem Investigation,So which of your services is not working?
Problem Investigation,Alright how about sending and receiving messages?
Problem Investigation,Do you have any problems with those?
Problem Investigation,What about your internet?
Problem Investigation,I just really want to make sure that you don't have any problems with those.
Problem Investigation,"And, now we just really need to focus on your phone calls."
Problem Investigation,"So, let me ask you this have you tried doing any basic troubleshooting before you called?"
Problem Investigation,Like turning off your phone and turning it back?
Problem Investigation,When was the last time that you were able to make a phone call?
Problem Investigation,"Okay, is this happening to all of the phone numbers that you're trying to call in?"
Problem Investigation,Is this happening in all locations or just one specific location?
Problem Investigation,"So right now, can you tell me if your wi-fi is on or off?"
Problem Investigation,What about your airplane mode?
Problem Investigation,Is it on or off?
Problem Investigation,What about your mobile data?
Problem Investigation,It's the same one and also let me check the coverage in your area.

Problem Investigation,"Okay, Alright, as I checked, we don't have any problems with the coverage in your area."
Problem Investigation,It's 4G and no current outages too.
Problem Investigation,Let me go and check what's the problem and let's fix it together.
Problem Investigation,"Thank you and just to clarify when you said that the printer is not working, do you mean it's not turning on or do you see any error message or you can't print from your computer?"
Problem Investigation,"Alright, do you have a windows computer or a mac?"
Problem Investigation,It's uh connected wirelessly or usb cable?
Problem Investigation,"To make sure that this is not a printer problem, we will try to do a copy test."
Problem Investigation,"So, you have to photocopy any documents and make sure it's coloured and if output is perfect that means that the printer is good. "
Problem Investigation,That means there's no problem on your printer. 
Problem Investigation,"Okay, I understand that you need assistance on how to clear the browsing history on your browser and I know that this is very important for you to be addressed."
Problem Investigation,So let me go ahead and assist you now on how we can clear the browsing history.
Problem Investigation,Okay but I need to understand what browser browser are you using on your computer.
Problem Investigation,Is the browser that you're using Internet Explorer or Google Chrome?
Problem Investigation,"Internet Explorer actually looks like a blue letter e icon and about Google Chrome it's a round icon away the red, green and yellow colours inside."
Problem Investigation,That's the one you're using.
Problem Investigation,"So, for us to get started in troubleshooting your browser, please make sure that your Google Chrome or browser is open now on your computer."
Problem Investigation,"Okay so now that it's done, would you like us to test the resolution?"
